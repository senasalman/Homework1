# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

- There are 1 character (country) and 4 numeric variables (beer_servings, spirit_servings, wine_servings, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol). We don't have any missing data, they are all complete.

```{r glimpse_skim_data_drinks}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
data(drinks)
skim(drinks)
# No missing values!
```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
beer_data<-drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
  slice(1:25)

beer_data
ggplot(beer_data, aes(y=reorder(country,beer_servings),x=beer_servings))+
  geom_col() +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title="Beer Consumption Top 25 Countries", subtitle= "in # Beer Serving consumed per person in 2010\n", y="", x="\n # Beer Servings") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))


```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
wine_data <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))%>%
  slice(1:25)

wine_data
ggplot(wine_data, aes(y=reorder(country,wine_servings),x=wine_servings))+
  geom_col() +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title="Wine Consumption Top 25 Countries", subtitle= "in # Wine Serving consumed per person in 2010\n", y="", x="\n # Wine Servings") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
spirit_data <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))%>%
  slice(1:25)

spirit_data
ggplot(spirit_data, aes(y=reorder(country,spirit_servings),x=spirit_servings))+
  geom_col() +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title="Spirit Consumption Top 25 Countries", subtitle= "in # Spirit Serving consumed per person in 2010\n", y="", x="\n # Spirit Servings") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))
```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

We can see significant differences in alcohol consumption over three classes of alcohol: beer, wine, and spirits. This comes along with at least two reasons behind it:

First, culture and secondly wealth. For beer consumption we see that Namibia has the highest as it used to be a German colony, Czech Republic with the City of Pilsen (founding place for the beer type: "Pils") has the second highest beer consumption, and Germany has the 4th highest beer consumption with its long history of beer making and currently more than 1,500 beer breweries all over Germany. What is more, we see that muslim countries are not included in the top alcohol consuming countries, as their religion and culture is against alcohol. For the wealth we can see that a lot of rich western countries have a higher consumption as they have more money to spend on luxury goods, i.e. alcohol.
- Type of alcohol depending on 
- German history , had a lot of wheat, started to produce beer ...b gfdg
- sterotypes (France: wine, Germany: beer, spirit: Russia, Belarus)

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- vroom::vroom("movies.csv")
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
```{r}
skim(movies)
sum(duplicated(movies))
```
- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r}
 movies %>%
    group_by(genre) %>%
    count(sort=TRUE) 
```
- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order
```{r}
movies_genre<- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(avg_gross=mean(gross),avg_budget=mean(budget)) %>% 
  mutate(return_on_budget=avg_gross-avg_budget) %>% 
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

movies_genre
```
- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.
```{r}
movies_director<-movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(total=sum(gross),mean=mean(gross),median=median(gross),sd=sd(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  head(15)

movies_director
```
- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 
```{r}
movies_rating<-movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(mean=mean(rating),min=min(rating),max=max(rating),median=median(rating),sd=sd(rating)) 
movies_rating

p<-ggplot(movies,aes(rating))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~genre)+
  theme_economist()+
  labs(title="Distribution of movie ratings among different genre", y="Count of observations\n", x="Rating")
p
```
## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
Y-axes should be 'gross', X-axes should be 'cast_facebook_likes'.  
Cast_facebook_likes does bot seem to be a good indicator of the gross revenue a movie will make, as there is no linear relationship between the two variable.  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes, fig.width=10}
glimpse(movies)
ggplot(movies, aes(y=gross, x=cast_facebook_likes))+
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) +
  theme_economist()+
  labs(title="Relationship between Facebook likes and gross profit in box office", x="\nFacebook likes", y="Profit in box office\n" )
```
The scatterplot and the regression line clearly indicates the relationship between higher cast_facebook_likes and higher gross earnings in the US box office (the regression line shows a positive incline).

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.
  
Budget is also not a good indicator of gross revenue a movie can make, since the scatterplot is very scattered.
```{r, gross_on_budget, fig.width=10}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=gross, y=budget))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)+
  labs(title="Relationship between budget and gross profit in box office", x="\nProfit in box office", y="Budget\n" )+
  theme_economist()
```
Also, this scatterplot and the regression line clearly indicates the relationship between higher budget and higher gross earnings in the US box office (the regression line shows a positive incline).
 
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

For most genres, the higher the ratings are, the more gross revenue a movie will make at the box office.

In some genres there is even a negative correlation, i.e. Documentary. However, for the genres with many data points, i.e. Action, Adventure, Commedy, Crime, Drama, we can see a slightly positive correlation between the ratings and the money spend in box offices.
However, animation, documentary, fantasy and sci-fi are exceptions.
For family, romance, musical, thriller and western, the data is not sufficient to tell any relationships.
The dataset is biased towards certain genres of movies, and it fail to represent the complete landscape of the movie industry.
```{r, gross_on_rating, fig.width=10}
ggplot(movies, aes(y=gross, x=rating))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  geom_smooth(mothod=lm, se=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~genre)+
  labs(title = "Relationship between rating and gross profit in box office\n", x="\nRating", y="Gross profit in box office\n")+
  theme_economist()
```


# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2021.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv("nyse.csv")
glimpse(nyse)
skim(nyse)
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

companies_per_sector <- nyse %>%
  group_by(sector)%>%
  summarise(Number_of_Companies = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(Number_of_Companies))

ggplot(companies_per_sector, aes(y=reorder(sector,Number_of_Companies),x=Number_of_Companies))+
  geom_col() +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title="Sectors with number of companies in it \n", y="", x="\nNumber of Companies") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0))
  
```

Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"

#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```




```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = "2020-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a dataframe and assign it to a new object, where you summarise monthly returns since 2017-01-01 for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

summarise_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>%
  group_by(symbol)%>%
  summarise(min_month_return = min(monthly_returns), 
            max_month_return = max(monthly_returns),
            median_month_return = median(monthly_returns),
            mean_month_return = mean(monthly_returns),
            sd_month_return = sd(monthly_returns)
            )
summarise_monthly_returns
```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}

ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x=monthly_returns))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(~symbol)+
  labs(title='Monthly Returns - Density Plots\n', x="\nMonthly returns", y="Percentage\n")+
  theme_economist()

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

We can see that the stocks densities seem to have a standard normal distribution. The stocks with the widest density plots have the most volatility present. The riskiest stock form what we can see in the graphs seems to be AXP and the least risky AAPL

Finally, produce a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock with its ticker symbol

```{r risk_return_plot}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(summarise_monthly_returns, aes(y=mean_month_return, x=sd_month_return, label=symbol))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel()+
  geom_lm(method=lm,se=FALSE)+
  theme_economist()+
  labs(title="Relation between monthly return and risk\n", y="Monthly return", x="\nRisk (standard deviation)")

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

From the plot we can infer that as the mean monthly return rises, so does the standard deviation, which makes sense, since a higher return usually indicates higher variability in prices, meaning that the higher the return of the stock the more risk associated with the returns.
There are some cases, where the volatility (standard deviation) is high, with a lower mean monthly return. In particular, the biggest outliar is DOW, with a mean monthly return smaller than 0.01 and the highest standard deviation. There are some other cases bordering on having outliar-like characteristics, like Cisco Systems, american express and other financial services stocks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs.


# On your own: IBM HR Analytics


For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.


First let us load the data

```{r}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1. How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)
1. How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics? 
1. How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total
1. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?
1. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first
1. Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.
1. Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`
1. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

first, let's look at the cleaned data

```{r glimpse_skim_data_hr}
glimpse(hr_cleaned)
skim(hr_cleaned)
```

## count on attrition

```{r attrition}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(attrition) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(frequency = n/length(hr_cleaned$attrition))
```

## distribution of `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` 
* age, years_at_company, monthly_income and years_since_last_promotion are right skewed
* age is closer to normal distribution

```{r distribution}

```

## distribution of `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total

```{r distribution2}

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to make a publication-ready plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Open the journal article "Riddell_Annals_Hom-Sui-Disparities.pdf". Read the abstract and have a look at Figure 3. The data you need is "CDC_Males.csv".

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Replicate Figure 3
library(ggrepel)
CDC_Males <- vroom::vroom("CDC_Males.csv")
glimpse(CDC_Males)
skim(CDC_Males)
CDC_Males_Firearm<- 
CDC_Males%>%
  filter(type.fac=="Firearm-related") #filter for firearm-related only 

  ggplot(CDC_Males_Firearm, aes(x=crude.suicide.White, y=crude.homicide.White,size= average.pop.white, label=ST)) + #x-axis: white suicide rate, y-axis: white homicide rate, size of points by average white population, label points by state
  geom_point(aes(fill=gun.house.prev.category), color="black", stroke=0.8, shape=21, alpha=.6)+ #fill points by gun ownership category, outline color black, transparency .6, shape 21 because it is circle with fill and outline, stroke .8 is thickness of outline
  scale_fill_brewer(type="seq",palette="YlOrRd", direction=1,breaks= c("10.2%-19.9%", "20.0%-34.9%","35.0%-44.9%","45.0%-65.5%"),labels=c("10.2%-19.9%", "20.0%-34.9%","35.0%-44.9%","45.0%-65.5%")) + #colorscheme from colorbrewer2
  ggtitle("fig 3") + #plot title
  xlab("white suic") + ylab("white homic")+ #x and y axis labels
 theme_classic()+ # white background
  theme(plot.title= element_text(color="black", size=10), axis.title.x= element_text(color="black", size=9, face="bold"), axis.title.y=element_text(color="black", size=9, face="bold"),legend.title=element_text(face="bold", size=8), legend.text=element_text(face="bold", size=7))+ #font size and type for title, legend, and axis labels
  labs(fill="gun own",size="white p") + #legend titles
  guides(fill=guide_legend(order=1), size=guide_legend(order=2)) + # reorder legend
  scale_size_continuous(breaks=c(200000,500000,1500000,3000000,7000000), labels= c("200 000", "500 000","1 500 000", "3 000 000", "7 000 000"), range=c(2,8))+ #legend scale and labels
  geom_text_repel(segment.alpha=0, size=2.5)+ # point labels font and positioning
    annotate(geom="text", x=27, y=1, label="spearman corr: 0.72", size=2.5)+ #add Spearman correlation annotation
    
         NULL

```


Don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out.

# Challenge 2: 2016 California Contributors plots

As discussed in class, I would like you to reproduce the plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election.



```{r challenge2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "challenge2.png"), error = FALSE)
```


To get this plot, you must join two dataframes; the one you have with all contributions, and data that can translate zipcodes to cities.
You can find a file with all US zipcodes, e.g., here http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html. 

The easiest way would be to create two plots and then place one next to each other. For this, you will need the `patchwork` package.
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html

While this is ok, what if one asked you to create the same plot for the top 10 candidates and not just the top two? The most challenging part is how to reorder within categories, and for this you will find Julia Silge's post on [REORDERING AND FACETTING FOR GGPLOT2](https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/) useful.


```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Make sure you use vroom() as it is significantly faster than read.csv()
library(patchwork)
library(tidytext)
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom("CA_contributors_2016.csv")%>%
  mutate(zip = as.character(zip))

zip_codes <- vroom::vroom("zip_code_database.csv")%>%
  select(zip,primary_city)

top_candidates <- left_join(CA_contributors_2016,zip_codes)

top_candidates%>%
  group_by(cand_nm)%>%
  filter(cand_nm %in% c("Trump, Donald J.","Clinton, Hillary Rodham"))%>%
  group_by(cand_nm,primary_city)%>%
  summarise(city_donation=sum(contb_receipt_amt))%>%
  top_n(10)%>%
  mutate(cand_nm=as.factor(cand_nm), primary_city = reorder_within(primary_city,city_donation,cand_nm))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=city_donation, y=primary_city, fill=cand_nm))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~cand_nm,scales = "free")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  scale_y_reordered()+
  labs(x = "Amount raised",
         y = NULL,
         title = "Where did candidates raise most money?")
  
```
```{r, top10_candidates,fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
top10_cand_name <- top_candidates%>%
  group_by(cand_nm)%>%
  summarise(cand_donation=sum(contb_receipt_amt))%>%
  arrange(desc(cand_donation))%>%
  top_n(10)

top10_cand_city <- left_join(top10_cand_name,top_candidates,"cand_nm")%>%
  group_by(cand_nm,primary_city)%>%
  summarise(city_donation=sum(contb_receipt_amt))%>%
  top_n(10)%>%
  mutate(cand_nm=as.factor(cand_nm), primary_city = reorder_within(primary_city,city_donation,cand_nm))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=city_donation, y=primary_city, fill=cand_nm))+
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~cand_nm,scales = "free", nrow = 5)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format())+
  scale_y_reordered()+
  labs(x = "Amount raised",
         y = NULL,
         title = "Where did candidates raise most money?",
       subtitle = "Top 10 candidates by money raised")
  
  top10_cand_city

```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
